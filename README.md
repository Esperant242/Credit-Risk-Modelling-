# Credit Risk Modeling – Probability of Default (PD)

This project aims to build and evaluate a machine learning model to estimate the **Probability of Default (PD)** using the German Credit dataset. The project follows a complete end-to-end pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, performance evaluation, interpretability, and production readiness.

## 📌 Objective

To develop a predictive model for estimating the 12-month PD of loan applicants, suitable for applications in credit scoring, regulatory frameworks (IRB/Basel, IFRS 9), and credit decision support.

## 🏛️ Regulatory Context

- **IRB (Basel II/III)**: Development of Through-the-Cycle (TTC) PD models for capital requirement calculation.
- **IFRS 9**: Development of Point-in-Time (PIT) PD models used in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository – German Credit Data
- **Size**: 1000 observations, 20 features, binary target (`1` = default, `0` = no default)
- **Features**: Mix of categorical and numerical variables (e.g., credit history, loan amount, age)
